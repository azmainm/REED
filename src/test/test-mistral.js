      Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy, 
      usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates. During photosynthesis, 
      organisms take in carbon dioxide and water, using the energy from sunlight to convert them into glucose and oxygen.
      The chemical equation for photosynthesis is: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy â†’ C6H12O6 + 6O2.

      ${testText}
      """
      
      Create a conversation with the following characteristics:
      1. Start with a friendly greeting between teacher and student
      2. The teacher should guide the student through a series of questions that help them discover the key concepts themselves
      3. Follow the Socratic method where questions lead to critical thinking and insight
      4. Structure the dialogue as a back-and-forth conversation with clear speaker labels
      5. Include 5-7 exchanges that cover the main points from the text
      6. Conclude with a friendly goodbye
      7. Format the dialogue with clear speaker identifiers (Teacher: / Student:)
      
      The dialogue should feel natural and engaging.
      IMPORTANT: Return ONLY the dialogue content, with no additional text or commentary.
